Program: 11 Develop a C program that simulates a matchstick game between the user and the 
computer. The objective of the game is to avoid picking the last matchstick. The 
program should ensure that the computer always wins by strategically picking 
matchsticks. The game starts with 21 matchsticks. The user and the computer take 
turns to pick 1, 2, 3, or 4 matchsticks. The player forced to pick the last matchstick 
loses the game. 
Rules: 
1. The game starts with 21 matchsticks. 
2. The user is asked to pick 1, 2, 3, or 4 matchsticks. 
3. After the user picks, the computer makes its pick. 
4. The player who is forced to pick the last matchstick loses the game 
Code: #include<stdio.h> 
void main(){ 
 int user_pick , matchsticks=21 , computer_pick; 
 printf("Rules Of Game :\n1. The game starts with 21 matchsticks."); 
 printf("\n2. The user is asked to pick 1, 2, 3, or 4 matchsticks."); 
 printf("\n3. After the user picks, the computer makes its pick."); 
 printf("\n4. The player who is forced to pick the last matchstick loses thegame"); 
 printf("\n\n\nTotal match sticks is 21."); 
 // Using Loop and Show The Output. 
 while(1){ 
 
 printf("\nPick Your Matchsticks 1 To 4 ONLY :"); 
 scanf("%d",&user_pick); 
 if(user_pick>5 || user_pick<1){ 
 
 printf("\nPlease Enter A valid Input!!! \nRange of 1 to 4.");
  } 
 if(user_pick<=4 || user_pick>=1){ // When User Enter Range of 1 To 4 This condition is True 
And Run. 
 matchsticks = matchsticks - user_pick; 
 
 printf("\nTotal matchstics is :%d",matchsticks); 
 computer_pick = 5 - user_pick; 
 
 printf("\nComputer Pick is : %d",computer_pick); 
 matchsticks = matchsticks-computer_pick; 
 
 
 } // when Last one matchstick is now this condition is true And Run.. 
 if(matchsticks==1){ 
 
 printf("\nTotal matchsticks is : %d",matchsticks); 
 
 printf("\nYou Are Looser!!!"); 
 break; 
 } 
 }
 printf("\n24ce032_TARANG");
